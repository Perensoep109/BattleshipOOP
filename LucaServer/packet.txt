First game initialization packet:
	This packet is sent from the person starting the game, to the server.
	Format:
	[A][B]
		  [C1]
		  	  [D]
		  	  	 [EEEEEE]

		  [C2 C2]
		  		 [D]
		  		 	[EEEEEE]

	- A: A byte indicating the type of the packet. In this case it is an 'initialize game' packet.
	- B: A byte indicating the type of board.
	- C1: if B = 1, the board is square, so a single number that will be width and height.
	- C2: if B = 2, the board is rectangular, so two numbers that will be the width and height, respectively.
	- D: Amount of players. A number between 2 and 15. 
	- E: This is a code made up of 6 bytes (chars) that will be generated by the client that starts the game. The
	other client that want to join the match should enter it, so the server knows who wants to join which match.
	This code can be made up of both uppercase or lowercase letters, meaning that there are 52 possibilities per
	char, meaning that because we have 6 chars, we will have 52^6 possible combinations. The sever software will
	be able to handle that amount of simultaneous matches.
