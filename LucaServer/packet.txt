Packet details:
	Client > server packets:
		Initialize a game:
			Description: 
			This packet is sent from the person starting the game, to the 
			server.

			Format:
			[A][B]
				  [C1]
				  	  [D]
				  	  	 [EEEEEE]

				  [C2 C2]
				  		 [D]
				  		 	[EEEEEE]

			- A: A byte indicating the type of the packet. In this case it is an 
			'initialize game' packet.
			- B: A byte indicating the type of board.
			- C1: if B = 1, the board is square, so a single number that will be 
			width and height.
			- C2: if B = 2, the board is rectangular, so two numbers that will be 
			the width and height, respectively.
			- D: Amount of players. A number between 2 and 15. 
			- E: This is a code made up of 6 bytes (chars) that will be generated by
			the client that starts the game. The other client that want to join the 
			match should enter it, so the server knows who wants to join which 
			match. This code can be made up of both uppercase or lowercase letters, 
			meaning that there are 52 possibilities per char, meaning that because 
			we have 6 chars, we will have 52^6 possible combinations. The sever 
			software willbe able to handle that amount of simultaneous matches.
